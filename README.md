# Disco-Explorer-Remastered
An updated version of Disco Explorer for Disco Elysium - The Final Cut

[Original Mod repo](https://github.com/tparker48/Disco-Elysium-Mod)

[Original Mod on Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/discoelysium/mods/12)


## Info
* The Final Cut uses il2cpp and thus completey breaks the original mod
* This update swaps UnityModManager for BepinEx 6.0, as it supports modding il2cpp games

## Changes
As of now, no changes to the original mod are planned. This update will simply get it working for the new game.
