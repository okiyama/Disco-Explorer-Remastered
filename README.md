# Disco-Explorer-Remastered
An updated version of Disco Explorer for Disco Elysium - The Final Cut

## Info
* The Final Cut uses il2cpp and thus completey breaks the original mod
* This update swaps UnitModManager for BepinEx 6.0, as it supports modding il2cpp games

## Changes
As of now, no changes to the original mod are planned. This update will simply get it working for the new game.
